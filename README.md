# Alexa-Voice-Assistant
This project is a simple voice assistant named Alexa, built using Python. The assistant can recognize voice commands, perform actions such as playing YouTube videos, telling the current time, fetching information from Wikipedia, and telling jokes. It uses several Python libraries to achieve these functionalities.

Features
Voice Recognition: Uses speech_recognition to recognize and process voice commands.
Text-to-Speech: Uses pyttsx3 to convert text to speech.
YouTube Playback: Uses pywhatkit to play YouTube videos based on voice commands.
Current Time: Tells the current time using the datetime module.
Wikipedia Information: Fetches and reads out summaries from Wikipedia.
Jokes: Tells random jokes using the pyjokes library.
